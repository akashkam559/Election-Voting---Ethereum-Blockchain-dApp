Overview / What is it ??
----------------------------
Election Voting dApp Using Ethereum Blockchain Network With MetaMask in Solidity, individually developed a client-side dApp web application that allows accounts to cast votes. Blockchain-based voting ecosystem allowing anyone anywhere to vote online from a digital device in a fully secure. 

Motiation / Why is it ??
-----------------------------
Ensure secure and transparent digital voting that votes are counted only once & cryptographically secured by SHA-256 hashing. It’s end-to-end verifiable voting technology eradicates fraud and corruption by creating a complete, auditable, undisputable, open and transparent record of the election on a custom blockchain. 

3 pillars of blockchain for reason 
* Decentralization.
* Transparency.
* Immutability.

Reason ??
-----------
Purpose was to eliminate the current difficulties of offline-physical voting system and make it completely decentralized using the blockchain network and make elections more efficient, less expensive, tension-free. 

Tech Used
-----------
* Language : Solidity & VS Code

* Other Libraries : Node.js NPM, Ganache, Truffle, web3Js 

* Ethereum Virtual machine (allows developers to create decentralized applications (Dapps): MetaMask (web applications to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain, crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps, equips you with a key vault, secure login, and token wallet)


Advantages
------------
* Tamper-proof - Ballots and results cannot be altered by any third party

* Transparent - The entire voting process is fully transparent and publicly verifiable

* Private - Voters’ choices and identities are protected

* Accessible - can participate in a modern, convenient and fair way

* Affordable - Digitization of paper and manual processes reduces election costs,

* Tension-less - Eliminating violence caused by questionable results.


Installation Dependencies
---------------------------
Step 1. Require mandatory dependencies
------------------------------------------
Install these prerequisites to follow along with the tutorial.

NPM: https://nodejs.org

Truffle: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle

Ganache: http://truffleframework.com/ganache/

Metamask: https://metamask.io/


Step 2. Install dependencies
--------------------------
cd election
npm install

Step 3. Start Ganache
--------------------------
Open the Ganache GUI client that you downloaded and installed. This will start your local blockchain instance

Step 4. Compile & Deploy Election Smart Contract
--------------------------

truffle migrate --reset You must migrate the election smart contract each time your restart ganache.

Step 5. Configure Metamask
--------------------------
Unlock Metamask
Connect metamask to your local Etherum blockchain provided by Ganache.
Import an account provided by ganache.

Step 6. Run the Front End Application
----------------------------------------
npm run dev Visit this URL in your browser: http://localhost:3000

Result/Summary
---------------
* Individually developed client-side dApp web app. that allows accounts to cast votes.

* Allow anyone & anywhere to vote online from a digital device

* Ensure secure and transparent digital voting that votes are counted only once &
cryptographically secured by SHA-256 hashing.

* End-to-end verifiable voting technology eradicates fraud and corruption & eliminate the
current difficulties of offline-physical voting system by creating more efficient, less expensive

Future scope of project
------------------------
Can be more secure with upgraded technology

powerful & next footprint-step of security and technology
