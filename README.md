# Election-Voting---Ethereum-Blockchain-dApp
lection Voting - Ethereum Blockchain dApp on the Ethereum Blockchain Network With MetaMask Developed a client-side web 

What is it ??
---------------
Election Voting dApp Using Ethereum Blockchain Network With MetaMask in Solidity, individually developed a client-side dApp web application that allows accounts to cast votes. Blockchain-based voting ecosystem allowing anyone anywhere to vote online from a digital device in a fully secure. 

Why is it ??
-------------------
Ensure secure and transparent digital voting that votes are counted only once & cryptographically secured by SHA-256 hashing. It’s end-to-end verifiable voting technology eradicates fraud and corruption by creating a complete, auditable, undisputable, open and transparent record of the election on a custom blockchain. 

3 pillars of blockchain for reason 
* Decentralization.
* Transparency.
* Immutability.

Reason ??
-----------
Purpose was to eliminate the current difficulties of offline-physical voting system and make it completely decentralized using the blockchain network and make elections more efficient, less expensive, tension-free. 

Tech Used
-----------
* Language : Solidity & VS Code

* Other Libraries : Node.js NPM, Ganache, Truffle, web3Js 

* Ethereum Virtual machine (allows developers to create decentralized applications (Dapps): MetaMask (web applications to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain, crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps, equips you with a key vault, secure login, and token wallet)


Advantages
------------
* Tamper-proof - Ballots and results cannot be altered by any third party

* Transparent - The entire voting process is fully transparent and publicly verifiable

* Private - Voters’ choices and identities are protected

* Accessible - can participate in a modern, convenient and fair way

* Affordable - Digitization of paper and manual processes reduces election costs,

* Tension-less - Eliminating violence caused by questionable results.


OUTPUT
